# TTK21 Lecture 2 exercises

I will each week try to put together at few exercises in [python notebooks](https://jupyter.org/), 
which contains a set of instructions and code you can run.
They can be run on [mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/) by clicking on the launch buttons below,
or you can [install and run jupyter](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46) on you own machine.

## Exercise notebooks
- [1_poses-and-cameras.ipynb](1_poses-and-cameras.ipynb) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ttk21/ttk21_lecture-2_exercises/master?filepath=1_poses-and-cameras.ipynb)
- [2_epipolar-geometry.ipynb](2_epipolar-geometry.ipynb) [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ttk21/ttk21_lecture-2_exercises/master?filepath=2_epipolar-geometry.ipynb)

## Dependencies
The exercises are based on [visgeom](https://github.com/tussedrotten/visgeom), a small visualisation library I made for this course.
Binder will use [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) to install this library and everything else it needs automatically.
You can also do this manually using `pip`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
